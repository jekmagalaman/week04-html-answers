        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The Flash (2023) follows Barry Allen as he travels back in time to prevent his mother’s murder. 
            However, this decision creates an alternate reality where metahumans don’t exist, 
            General Zod returns, and Bruce Wayne is a different Batman. 
            Barry teams up with his past self, Supergirl, and Michael Keaton’s Batman 
            to restore the timeline and stop Zod.

        <h3>Alternate Timeline</h3>

        <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            a kind of movie you watch with a goofy smile on your face, 
            particularly during Michael Keaton's welcome return as Batman and Sasha Calle's
            too-brief introduction as Supergirl. But it's ultimately a mixed bag of great moments run aground by a threadbare plot about a multiversal crisis that lacks the emotional heft to support its ambition, leaving me feeling as if the whole story was a bit discombobulated and ungraspable in terms of motivations; even as a teasing look at a summer tentpole movie to come, much of the film looks impressive but struggles to hold up its own story weight, and while a technically proficient and fun offering at the cinema.
